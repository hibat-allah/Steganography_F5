### What is Steganography?
Steganography is the art of hiding a secret message within (or even on top of) a non-secret object. This can be anything you want. Many forms of steganography nowadays include hiding a secret piece of text within a photograph. Alternatively, you may hide a secret message or script inside a Word or Excel document.
In this work we will hide a .txt file inside an image.
